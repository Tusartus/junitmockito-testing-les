Yes, unit testing is usually applied to smaller, isolated components of a system, such as a PostRepository class. Unit tests are designed to test individual units of code in isolation from the rest of the system. This means that the dependencies of the unit being tested are replaced with test doubles, such as mock objects, to ensure that the unit under test is the only thing being evaluated.

Unit tests are typically written using TDD principles, but they can also be written using BDD principles. The goal of unit tests is to verify that the code works as expected, and that any changes made to the code do not break existing functionality. By writing and maintaining a suite of unit tests, developers can be confident that changes to the codebase do not introduce new bugs, and that the system continues to work as expected.

In the case of a PostRepository, unit tests could be written to verify that it correctly retrieves, inserts, updates, and deletes posts from a database. The tests would use test doubles to simulate the database and ensure that the repository behaves as expected. This way, the repository can be tested in isolation, without having to worry about the behavior of other components in the system
